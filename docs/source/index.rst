IBLPy is a API wrapper/library around https://infinitybots.xyz, which is a great novel bot list for the next generation of bots owned by ``☣ Tσxιƈ Dҽʋ ☣#7308``.

This library should be complete with the full API (at least as of time of writing this) but IBL may add or change their APIs so IBLPy might not be complete then (but will be updated if this happens)
